title: "Re-architecting GoPollGo: JavaScript, MVC, and the Importance of Structure"
excerpt: "Like many ambitious web projects, with organic growth fueled by tight deadlines and the heroic efforts of a small team of developers, GoPollGo eventually found itself with a body of client-side code that could use somewhat of a facelift. Newly three developers strong, we took the opportunity provided by an upcoming major release (check out GoPollGo's new design and read about our backend overhaul) to think hard about how best to organize our increasingly complex JavaScript code base. The name of the game here was maintainability: as a startup, we pride our ability to quickly iterate - to respond to users' demands, to find and fix bugs, and to constantly improve."

<p>GoPollGo has just launched.  Welcome to the site!  What you're looking at is the culmination of three very busy months.  We are very excited to launch, learn, and continue to produce the best way to show what people think.  Huzzah!</p>

<p>Keep an eye on our blog, as we're going to do our best to update it regularly with content.  We'll talk about entrepreneurship, the engineering behind the site, new features, and maybe even some nifty reports we can come up with for entertainment.  It should be super rad.</p>

<h3>On the horizon</h3>
<p>We're looking to iterate very quickly.  Even with initial launch, we've gotten a lot of great feedback from you all and have already pushed some changes live.  Yes, we are *that* quick.  Primarily, we will be working on the premium analytics system which shows more in-depth reports and analysis of data.  We'll also be announcing a few partners we are working with currently.  Who knows, we may even have some hip new features right around the corner.</p>

<p>Here is a sneak peak at the advanced analytics:</p>

<p>There a number of people to thank that help made launch go smoothly as possible.
